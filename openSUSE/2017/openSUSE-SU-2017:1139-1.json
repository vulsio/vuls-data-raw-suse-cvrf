			"text": "\nThis update for feh on Leap 42.1 fixes this security issue:\n\n- CVE-2017-7875: In wallpaper.c in feh if a malicious client pretended to be the E17 window manager, it was possible to trigger an out-of-boundary heap write while receiving an IPC message. An integer overflow leads to a buffer overflow and/or a double free (bsc#1034567).\n\nThis update for feh on Leap 42.2 to version 2.18.3 fixes several issues.\n\nThis security issue was fixed on Leap 42.2:\n\n- CVE-2017-7875: In wallpaper.c in feh if a malicious client pretended to be the E17 window manager, it was possible to trigger an out-of-boundary heap write while receiving an IPC message. An integer overflow leads to a buffer overflow and/or a double free (bsc#1034567).\n\nThese non-security issue was fixed on Leap 42.2:\n\n- boo#955576: added jpegexiforient\n- Fixed image-specific format specifiers not being updated correctly in thumbnail mode window titles\n- Fixed memory leak when closing images opened from thumbnail mode\n- Fixed a possible out of bounds read caused by an unterminated string when using --output to save images in long paths\n- Fixed out of bounds read/write when handling empty or broken caption files.\n- Fixed memory leak when saving a filelist or image whose target filename already exists.\n- Fixed image-specific format specifiers not being updated correctly\n- New key binding: ! -  zoom_fill (zoom to fill window, may cut off image parts\n- Disable EXIF-based auto rotation by default\n- Added --auto-rotate option to enable auto rotation \n- Added feh-makefile_app.patch -- fix install location of icons\n- Install feh icon (both 48x48 and scalable SVG) to /usr/share/icons when running 'make install app=1'\n- Fixed --sort not being respected after the first reload when used in conjunction with --reload\n- All key actions can now also be bound to a button by specifying them in .config/feh/buttons. However, note that button actions can not be bound to keys.\n- Rename 'menu' key action to 'toggle_menu', 'prev' to 'prev_img' and 'next' to 'next_img'. The old names are still supported, but no longer documented.\n- feh now also sets the X11 _NET_WM_PID and WM_CLIENT_MACHINE window properties\n- Fixed compilation on systems where HOST_NAME_MAX is not defined\n- Also support in-place editing for images loaded via libcurl or imagemagick. Results will not be written back to disk in this case.\n- Fixed crash when trying to rotate a JPEG image without having jpegtran / jpegexiforient installed\n- Handle failing fork() calls gracefully\n- Fixed invalid key/button definitions mis-assigning keys/buttons to other actions\n- Added sort mode --sort dirname to sort images by directory instead of by name.\n- Added navigation keys next_dir (]) and prev_dir ([) to jump to the first image of the nex/previous directory \n- Fixed toggle_filenames key displaying wrong file numbers in multiwindow mode\n- Rescale image when resizing a window and --scale-down or --geometry is active.\n- Fixed --keep-zoom-vp not keeping the viewport x/y offsets \n- Fixed w (size_to_image) key not updating window size when --scale-down or --geometry is active\n- Added --insecure option to disable HTTPS certificate checks\n- Added --no-recursive option to disable recursive directory expansion.\n- Improve --scale-down in tiling environments.\n- --action and --action[1..9] now support action titles\n- -f / --filelist: Do not print useless error message when a correct filelist file is specified\n- -f / --filelist: Fix bug in '-' / '/dev/stdin' handling affecting feh running in ksh and possibly other environments\n- Add --xinerama-index option for background setting\n- When removing the last image in slidsehow mode, stay on the last (previously second-to-last) image\n- Allow --sort and --randomize to override each other (most recently specified option wins) instead of always preferring --sort\n- Thumbnail mode: Mark image as processed when executing an action (--action) by clicking on an image\n- It is now possible to override feh's idea of the active xinerama screen using the --xinerama-index option\n- Removed (undocumented) feature allowing to override feh's idea of the active xinerama screen by setting the XINERAMA_SCREEN environment variable\n- Removed obsolete gpg macro \n",
