			"text": "This update for freeciv fixes the following issues:\n\n- update to 3.0.3 (boo#1202548, CVE-2022-6083):\n\n  * 3.0.3 is a bugfix release\n  * see https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/NEWS-3.0.3 \n\n- update to 3.0.2:\n\n  * 3.0.2 is a generic bugfix release\n  * see https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/NEWS-3.0.2 \n\n- update to 3.0.1:\n\n  * 3.0.1 is a generic bugfix release\n  * see https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/NEWS-3.0.1 \n\n- update to 3.0.0:\n\n  * This release is a major upgrade which with some changes that\n    can support backward compatible rulesets\n  * see https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/NEWS-3.0.0#WHAT.27S_CHANGED_SINCE_2.6\n\n- update to 2.6.6:\n\n  * https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/NEWS-2.6.5\n  * 2.6.6 is a bugfix release.\n\n- update to 2.6.5:\n\n  * https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/NEWS-2.6.5\n  * 2.6.5 is a bugfix release. Notably it fixes regression in 2.6.4 gtk3-client\n    that present units in city dialog had no overlays drawn at all. \n\n- Update to 2.6.4:\n\n  * Bugfix release, see https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/NEWS-2.6.4\n\n- update to 2.6.3:\n\n  * see http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/NEWS-2.6.3\n  * Fixed trouble when a new city is founded to the ruins of a former city,\n    and that new city establish a trade route with a player who had seen\n    former city, and is unaware that it had been destroyed HRM#871606\n  * Fixed a case where shared vision did not completely update\n    recipient's map HRM#846106\n  * Fixed a bug where one could paradrop to peaceful nation's territory\n    after continuing game from an old savegame HRM#879084\n  * Fixed a bug causing game sometimes to tell wrong reason of why an\n    action failed HRM#879880\n  * Cease fire no longer runs out with an already dead player, making his\n    former allies to hate the alive party of the treaty HRM#879055\n  * Made server not to end in a infinite loop after loading savegame with\n    too high phase number. Such a savegame was reported to be created\n    after spaceship was launched but game was still continued HRM#815196\n  * Unified writing of the city name Washington-on-the-Brazos\n    between rulesets, so it doesn't appear multiple times in the same\n    game in a bit different form HRM#867817\n  * Stealth units are no longer erroneously hidden even from allies\n    HRM#764976\n  * Placing initial units is now done in shuffled player order HRM#850656\n  * Corrupt worker tasks are cleared. Those can originate, e.g.,\n    from buggy pre-2.6.2.1 Qt-client, and live in old savegames HRM#901938\n  * In a ruleset, such as civ2civ3, where caravans can help building wonder\n    in a foreign city, refresh city info of the city owner when one does\n    HRM#907977\n  * Display of success probabilities for diplomats was off when targeting\n    stack of units instead of individual unit HRM#859761\n  * Fixed pillaging of extras that are caused by something else than\n    player actions. For the fix to work, both server and client must be\n    at least version 2.6.3 HRM#861508\n  * Civilian unit trying to paradrop to an enemy city dies HRM#870004\n  * Prevented dead player from getting techs via Tech_Parasite effect.\n    This caused trouble in alien ruleset where Tech_Parasite is granted\n     by a tech HRM#873692\n  * Improved support of CityTile requirement type HRM#877780\n  * Fixed trouble preventing Small Wonders from working as impr_reqs\n    for units HRM#884993\n  * Corrected success probability shown by action dialog when it depends\n    on a special kind of road HRM#897490\n  * The included Lua engine has been upgraded from 5.3.5 to 5.3.6. HRM#889425\n\n- update to 2.6.2.1:\n\n  * Fixed server crash when unit with zero move_rate is transformed\n  * Fixed crashes when using Direction objects in lua scripts \n  * Fixed crash when chatline text had opening tag without closing tag\n  * Fixes to the Qt client\n  * Updated translations\n  * Fixed Qt-client build against Qt-5.15 (removes freeciv-qt-5.15.patch )\n  * Documentation updates \n\n",
