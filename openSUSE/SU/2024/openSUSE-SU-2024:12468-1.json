Affected is the function sigsegvHandler of the file debug.c of the component Crash Report. The manipulation leads to denial of service. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. Upgrading to version 6.2.8 and 7.0.6 is able to address this issue. The patch is identified as 0bf90d944313919eb8e63d3588bf63a367f020a3. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211962 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: The vendor claims that this is not a DoS because it applies to the crash logging mechanism which is triggered after a crash has occurred.",
