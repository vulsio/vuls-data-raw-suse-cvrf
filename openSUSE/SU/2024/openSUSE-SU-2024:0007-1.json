		{
			"text": "This update for exim fixes the following issues:\n\nexim was updated to 4.97.1 (boo#1218387, CVE-2023-51766):\n\n  * Fixes for the smtp protocol smuggling (CVE-2023-51766)\n\nexim was updated to exim 4.96:\n\n  * Move from using the pcre library to pcre2.\n  * Constification work in the filters module required a major version\n    bump for the local-scan API.  Specifically, the 'headers_charset'\n    global which is visible via the API is now const and may therefore\n    not be modified by local-scan code.\n  * Bug 2819: speed up command-line messages being read in.  Previously a\n    time check was being done for every character; replace that with one\n    per buffer.\n  * Bug 2815: Fix ALPN sent by server under OpenSSL.  Previously the string\n    sent was prefixed with a length byte.\n  * Change the SMTP feature name for pipelining connect to be compliant with\n    RFC 5321.  Previously Dovecot (at least) would log errors during\n    submission.\n  * Fix macro-definition during '-be' expansion testing.  The move to\n    write-protected store for macros had not accounted for these runtime\n    additions; fix by removing this protection for '-be' mode.\n  * Convert all uses of select() to poll().\n  * Fix use of $sender_host_name in daemon process.  When used in certain\n    main-section options or in a connect ACL, the value from the first ever\n    connection was never replaced for subsequent connections.\n  * Bug 2838: Fix for i32lp64 hard-align platforms\n  * Bug 2845: Fix handling of tls_require_ciphers for OpenSSL when a value\n    with underbars is given.\n  * Bug 1895: TLS: Deprecate RFC 5114 Diffie-Hellman parameters.\n  * Debugging initiated by an ACL control now continues through into routing\n    and transport processes.\n  * The 'expand' debug selector now gives more detail, specifically on the\n    result of expansion operators and items.\n  * Bug 2751: Fix include_directory in redirect routers.  Previously a\n    bad comparison between the option value and the name of the file to\n    be included was done, and a mismatch was wrongly identified.\n  * Support for Berkeley DB versions 1 and 2 is withdrawn.\n  * When built with NDBM for hints DB's check for nonexistence of a name\n    supplied as the db file-pair basename.\n  * Remove the 'allow_insecure_tainted_data' main config option and the\n    'taint' log_selector.\n  * Fix static address-list lookups to properly return the matched item.\n    Previously only the domain part was returned.\n  * The ${run} expansion item now expands its command string elements after\n    splitting.  Previously it was before; the new ordering makes handling\n    zero-length arguments simpler.\n  * Taint-check exec arguments for transport-initiated external processes.\n    Previously, tainted values could be used.  This affects 'pipe', 'lmtp' and\n    'queryprogram' transport, transport-filter, and ETRN commands.\n    The ${run} expansion is also affected: in 'preexpand' mode no part of\n    the command line may be tainted, in default mode the executable name\n    may not be tainted.\n  * Fix CHUNKING on a continued-transport.  Previously the usabilility of\n    the facility was not passed across execs, and only the first message\n    passed over a connection could use BDAT; any further ones using DATA.\n  * Support the PIPECONNECT facility in the smtp transport when the helo_data\n    uses $sending_ip_address and an interface is specified.\n  * OpenSSL: fix transport-required OCSP stapling verification under session\n    resumption.\n  * TLS resumption: the key for session lookup in the client now includes\n    more info that a server could potentially use in configuring a TLS\n    session, avoiding oferring mismatching sessions to such a server.\n  * Fix string_copyn() for limit greater than actual string length.\n  * Bug 2886: GnuTLS: Do not free the cached creds on transport connection\n    close; it may be needed for a subsequent connection.\n  * Fix CHUNKING for a second message on a connection when the first was\n    rejected.\n  * Fix ${srs_encode ...} to handle an empty sender address, now returning\n    an empty address.\n  * Bug 2855: Handle a v4mapped sender address given us by a frontending\n    proxy.\n\nupdate to exim 4.95\n\n  * includes taintwarn (taintwarn.patch)\n  * fast-ramp queue run\n  * native SRS\n  * TLS resumption\n  * LMDB lookups with single key\n  * smtp transport option 'message_linelength_limit'\n  * optionally ignore lookup caches\n  * quota checking for appendfile transport during message reception\n  * sqlite lookups allow a 'file=<path>' option\n  * lsearch lookups allow a 'ret=full' option\n  * command line option for the notifier socket\n  * faster TLS startup\n  * new main config option 'proxy_protocol_timeout'\n  * expand 'smtp_accept_max_per_connection'\n  * log selector 'queue_size_exclusive'\n  * main config option 'smtp_backlog_monitor'\n  * main config option 'hosts_require_helo'\n  * main config option 'allow_insecure_tainted_data'",

This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Exim. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the smtp service, which listens on TCP port 25 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-17643.",
