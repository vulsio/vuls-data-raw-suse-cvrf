			"text": "This update for singularity fixes the following issues:\n\nsingularity was updated to version 3.4.1:\n\nThis point release addresses the following issues:\n\n- Fixes an issue where a PID namespace was always being used\n- Fixes compilation on non 64-bit architectures\n- Allows fakeroot builds for zypper, pacstrap, and debootstrap\n- Correctly detects seccomp on OpenSUSE\n- Honors GO_MODFLAGS properly in the mconfig generated makefile\n- Passes the Mac hostname to the VM in MacOS Singularity builds\n- Handles temporary EAGAIN failures when setting up loop devices on\nrecent kernels.\n\nNew version 3.4.0. Many changes since 3.2.1, for the full changelog \n  please read CHANGELOG.md\n\nUpdate to version 3.2.1:\n\nThis point release fixes the following bugs:\n\n- Allows users to join instances with non-suid workflow\n- Removes false warning when seccomp is disabled on the host\n- Fixes an issue in the terminal when piping output to commands\n- Binds NVIDIA persistenced socket when `--nv` is invoked\n\nImprove integration with SUSE Products: add support to create Singularity\nimages with SLE.\n\n* Newer SUSE versions use a different path for the RPM database.\n* When the installation succeeds by an installation scriptlet fails\n  zypper returns error code 107. Don't treat this as an error.\n* In order to specify a repository GPG key, add support for\n  multi line variables.\n* In order to specify a list of additional repos, add support\n  to 'indexed' variables.\n* Improve handling of SUSE repositires:\n\n  - For SLE, use SUSEConnect to get all product repos.\n  - Allow to specify a repository GPG key.\n  - Allow to specify additional installation repositories.\n\n- Add group 'singularity', fix ownerships.\n\nUpdated to singularity v3.2.0\n\n* CVE-2019-11328: Instance files are now stored in user's home directory for privacy and\n  many checks have been added to ensure that a user can't manipulate files\n  to change `starter-suid` behavior when instances are joined (many thanks\n  to Matthias Gerstner from the SUSE security team for finding and securely\n  reporting this vulnerability) (boo#1128598)\n\n* New features / functionalities\n\n  - Introduced a new basic framework for creating and managing plugins\n  - Added the ability to create containers through multi-stage builds\n  - Created the concept of a Sylabs Cloud 'remote' endpoint and added the\n    ability for users and admins to set them through CLI and conf files \n  - Added caching for images from Singularity Hub\n  - Made it possible to compile Singularity outside of `$GOPATH`\n  - Added a json partition to SIF files for OCI configuration when building\n    from an OCI source\n  - Full integration with Singularity desktop for MacOS code base\n\n* New Commands\n\n  - Introduced the `plugin` command group for creating and managing plugins.\n\n* Introduced the `remote` command group to support management of Singularity\n  endpoints.\n* Added to the `key` command group to improve PGP key management.\n* Added the `Stage: <name>` keyword to the definition file header and the\n  `from <stage name>` option/argument pair to the `%files` section to\n  support multistage builds\n* Deprecated / removed commands\n\n  - The `--token/-t` option has been deprecated in favor of the `singularity\n    remote` command group\n\n* Changed defaults / behaviors\n\n  - Ask to confirm password on a newly generated PGP key\n  - Prompt to push a key to the KeyStore when generated\n  - Refuse to push an unsigned container unless overridden with\n    `--allow-unauthenticated/-U` option\n  - Warn and prompt when pulling an unsigned container without the\n       `--allow-unauthenticated/-U` option\nFor more information check:\n   https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/blob/release-3.2/CHANGELOG.md\n\nUpdated to singularity v3.1.1:\n\n* New Commands\n\n  - New hidden `buildcfg` command to display compile-time parameters \n  - Added support for `LDFLAGS`, `CFLAGS`, `CGO_` variables in build system\n  - Added `--nocolor` flag to Singularity client to disable color in logging\n\n* Removed Commands\n\n  - `singularity capability <add/drop> --desc` has been removed\n  - `singularity capability list <--all/--group/--user>` flags have all\n    been removed \n\n* New features / functionalities\n  - The `--builder` flag to the `build` command implicitly sets `--remote`\n  - Repeated binds no longer cause Singularity to exit and fail, just warn\n    instead\n  - Corrected typos and improved docstrings throughout\n  - Removed warning when CWD does not exist on the host system\n  - Added support to spec file for RPM building on SLES 11\n\nUpdate to singularity 3.1.0 what is reimplementaion in go\nso this is a complete new build and just reusing the changelog\nentries, following build differences were made to the upstream\nspec file\n\n* build position independent executable\n* build stripped executable\n\n- Change from /var/singularity to /var/lib/singularity\n- Fix warning on bash-completion file about non-executible script.\n\n- Add bash completions directory to file list for suse_version < 1500\n  to keep the build checker happy.\n",
