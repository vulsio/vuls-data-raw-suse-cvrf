GCC12/CC_NO_ARRAY_BOUNDS\n  Upstream commit f0be87c42cbd (gcc-12: disable '-Warray-bounds'\n  universally for now) added two new compiler-dependent configs:\n  * CC_NO_ARRAY_BOUNDS\n  * GCC12_NO_ARRAY_BOUNDS\n  Ignore them -- they are unset by dummy tools (they depend on gcc version\n  == 12), but set as needed during real compilation.\n- commit a14607c\n- kernel-binary.spec: check s390x vmlinux location\n  As a side effect of mainline commit edd4a8667355 (&quot;/s390/boot: get rid of\n  startup archive&quot;/), vmlinux on s390x moved from &quot;/compressed&quot;/ subdirectory\n  directly into arch/s390/boot. As the specfile is shared among branches,\n  check both locations and let objcopy use one that exists.\n- commit cd15543\n- Add missing recommends of kernel-install-tools to kernel-source-vanilla (bsc#1200442)\n- commit 93b1375\n- kernel-binary.spec: Support radio selection for debuginfo.\n  To disable debuginfo on 5.18 kernel a radio selection needs to be\n  switched to a different selection. This requires disabling the currently\n  active option and selecting NONE as debuginfo type.\n- commit 43b5dd3\n- Add dtb-starfive\n- commit 85335b1\n- rpm/kernel-obs-build.spec.in: Also depend on dracut-systemd (bsc#1195775)\n- commit 5d4e32c\n- pahole 1.22 required for full BTF features.\n  also recommend pahole for kernel-source to make the kernel buildable\n  with standard config\n- commit 364f54b\n- use jobs not processors in the constraints\n  jobs is the number of vcpus available to the build, while processors\n  is the total processor count of the machine the VM is running on.\n- commit a6e141d\n- rpm/constraints.in: skip SLOW_DISK workers for kernel-source\n- commit e84694f\n- rpm/*.spec.in: remove backtick usage\n- commit 87ca1fb\n- rpm/kernel-obs-build.spec.in: add systemd-initrd and terminfo dracut module (bsc#1195775)\n- commit d9a821b\n- rpm/kernel-obs-build.spec.in: use default dracut modules (bsc#1195926,\n  bsc#1198484)\n  Let's iron out the reduced initrd optimisation in Tumbleweed.\n  Build full blown dracut initrd with systemd for SLE15 SP4.\n- commit ea76821\n- Add dtb-microchip\n- commit c797107\n- rpm/kernel-source.spec.in: temporary workaround for a build failure\n  Upstream c6x architecture removal left a dangling link behind which\n  triggers openSUSE post-build check in kernel-source, failing\n  kernel-source build.\n  A fix deleting the danglink link has been submitted but it did not make\n  it into 5.12-rc1. Unfortunately we cannot add it as a patch as patch\n  utility does not handle symlink removal. Add a temporary band-aid which\n  deletes all dangling symlinks after unpacking the kernel source tarball.\n  [jslaby] It's not that temporary as we are dragging this for quite some\n  time in master. The reason is that this can happen any time again, so\n  let's have this in packaging instead.\n- commit 52a1ad7\n\nPackage libassuan was updated:\n\n- update to 2.5.5:  * Fix a crash in the logging code\n  * Upgrade autoconf\n- update to 2.5.4:\n  * Fix some minor build annoyances\n- Update to 2.5.3:\n  * Add a timeout for writing to a SOCKS5 proxy.\n  * Add workaround for a problem with LD_LIBRARY_PATH on newer systems.\n- qemu-disable-fdpassing-test.patch: remove\n-Update to 2.5.2:\n  * configure.ac: Bump LT version to C8/A8/R2\n  * include libassuan.pc in the spec file\n\nPackage libcroco was updated:\n\n- Add libcroco-CVE-2020-12825.patch: limit recursion in block and  any productions (boo#1171685 CVE-2020-12825).\n\nPackage libjpeg-turbo was updated:\n\n  fix CVE-2020-35538 [bsc#1202915], Null pointer dereference in jcopy_sample_rows() function  + libjpeg-turbo-CVE-2020-35538.patch\n- security update\n- added patches\n\nPackage libksba was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1204357, CVE-2022-3515]  * Detect a possible overflow directly in the TLV parser.\n  * Add libksba-CVE-2022-3515.patch\n\nPackage libtasn1 was updated:\n\n- Add libtasn1-CVE-2021-46848.patch: Fixed off-by-one array size check  that affects asn1_encode_simple_der (CVE-2021-46848, bsc#1204690).\n\nPackage libtirpc was updated:\n\n- fix CVE-2021-46828: libtirpc: DoS vulnerability with lots of  connections (bsc#1201680)\n  - backport 0001-Fix-DoS-vulnerability-in-libtirpc.patch\n- exclude ipv6 addresses in client protocol 2 code (bsc#1200800)\n  - update 0001-rpcb_clnt.c-config-to-try-protocolversion-2-first.patch\n- fix memory leak in params.r_addr assignement (bsc#1198752)\n  - add 0001-fix-parms.r_addr-memory-leak.patch\n\nPackage libxml2 was updated:\n\n- Security fixes:  * [CVE-2022-40303, bsc#1204366] Fix integer overflows with\n    XML_PARSE_HUGE\n    + Added patch libxml2-CVE-2022-40303.patch\n  * [CVE-2022-40304, bsc#1204367] Fix dict corruption caused by\n    entity reference cycles\n    + Added patch libxml2-CVE-2022-40304.patch\n- Security fix: [bsc#1201978, CVE-2016-3709]\n  * Cross-site scripting vulnerability after commit 960f0e2\n  * Add libxml2-CVE-2016-3709.patch\n\nPackage libzypp was updated:\n\n- Resolver: Fix missing --[no]-recommends initialization in  update (fixes #openSUSE/zypper#459, bsc#1201972)\n- Log ONLY_NAMESPACE_RECOMMENDED because this is what corresponds\n  to --[no]-recommends.\n- version 17.31.2 (22)\n- UsrEtc: Store logrotate files in %{_distconfdir} if defined\n  (fixes #402)\n- Log backtrace on SIGABRT too.\n- Need to explicitly enable building experimental code.

See the timeline for details.\n- update to 3.38.2:\n  * Fix a problem with the Bloom filter optimization that might\n    cause an incorrect answer when doing a LEFT JOIN with a WHERE\n    clause constraint that says that one of the columns on the\n    right table of the LEFT JOIN is NULL.\n  * Other minor patches.\n- Remove obsolete configure flags\n- Package the Tcl bindings here again so that we only ship one copy\n  of SQLite (bsc#1195773).\n- update to 3.38.1:\n  * Fix problems with the new Bloom filter optimization that might\n    cause some obscure queries to get an incorrect answer.\n  * Fix the localtime modifier of the date and time functions so\n    that it preserves fractional seconds.\n  * Fix the sqlite_offset SQL function so that it works correctly\n    even in corner cases such as when the argument is a virtual\n    column or the column of a view.\n  * Fix row value IN operator constraints on virtual tables so that\n    they work correctly even if the virtual table implementation\n    relies on bytecode to filter rows that do not satisfy the\n    constraint.\n  * Other minor fixes to assert() statements, test cases, and\n    documentation. See the source code timeline for details.\n- add upstream patch to run atof1 tests only on x86_64\n  sqlite-src-3380100-atof1.patch\n- update to 3.38.0\n  * Add the -&gt; and -&gt;&gt; operators for easier processing of JSON\n  * The JSON functions are now built-ins\n  * Enhancements to date and time functions\n  * Rename the printf() SQL function to format() for better\n    compatibility, with alias for backwards compatibility.\n  * Add the sqlite3_error_offset() interface for helping localize\n    an SQL error to a specific character in the input SQL text\n  * Enhance the interface to virtual tables\n  * CLI columnar output modes are enhanced to correctly handle tabs\n    and newlines embedded in text, and add options like &quot;/--wrap N&quot;/,\n    &quot;/--wordwrap on&quot;/, and &quot;/--quote&quot;/ to the columnar output modes.\n  * Query planner enhancements using a Bloom filter to speed up\n    large analytic queries, and a balanced merge tree to evaluate\n    UNION or UNION ALL compound SELECT statements that have an\n    ORDER BY clause.\n  * The ALTER TABLE statement is changed to silently ignores\n    entries in the sqlite_schema table that do not parse when\n    PRAGMA writable_schema=ON\n- update to 3.37.2:\n  * Fix a bug introduced in version 3.35.0 (2021-03-12) that can\n    cause database corruption if a SAVEPOINT is rolled back while\n    in PRAGMA temp_store=MEMORY mode, and other changes are made,\n    and then the outer transaction commits\n  * Fix a long-standing problem with ON DELETE CASCADE and ON\n    UPDATE CASCADE in which a cache of the bytecode used to\n    implement the cascading change was not being reset following a\n    local DDL change\n- update to 3.37.1:\n  * Fix a bug introduced by the UPSERT enhancements of version\n    3.35.0 that can cause incorrect byte-code to be generated for\n    some obscure but valid SQL, possibly resulting in a NULL-\n    pointer dereference.\n  * Fix an OOB read that can occur in FTS5 when reading corrupt\n    database files.\n  * Improved robustness of the --safe option in the CLI.\n  * Other minor fixes to assert() statements and test cases.\n- SQLite3 3.37.0:\n  * STRICT tables provide a prescriptive style of data type\n    management, for developers who prefer that kind of thing.\n  * When adding columns that contain a CHECK constraint or a\n    generated column containing a NOT NULL constraint, the\n    ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN now checks new constraints against\n    preexisting rows in the database and will only proceed if no\n    constraints are violated.\n  * Added the PRAGMA table_list statement.\n  * Add the .connection command, allowing the CLI to keep multiple\n    database connections open at the same time.\n  * Add the --safe command-line option that disables dot-commands\n    and SQL statements that might cause side-effects that extend\n    beyond the single database file named on the command-line.\n  * CLI: Performance improvements when reading SQL statements that\n    span many lines.\n  * Added the sqlite3_autovacuum_pages() interface.\n  * The sqlite3_deserialize() does not and has never worked\n    for the TEMP database. That limitation is now noted in the\n    documentation.\n  * The query planner now omits ORDER BY clauses on subqueries and\n    views if removing those clauses does not change the semantics\n    of the query.\n  * The generate_series table-valued function extension is modified\n    so that the first parameter (&quot;/START&quot;/) is now required. This is\n    done as a way to demonstrate how to write table-valued\n    functions with required parameters. The legacy behavior is\n    available using the -DZERO_ARGUMENT_GENERATE_SERIES\n    compile-time option.\n  * Added new sqlite3_changes64() and sqlite3_total_changes64()\n    interfaces.\n  * Added the SQLITE_OPEN_EXRESCODE flag option to sqlite3_open_v2().\n  * Use less memory to hold the database schema.\n  * bsc#1189802, CVE-2021-36690: Fix an issue with the SQLite Expert\n    extension when a column has no collating sequence.\n\nPackage sudo was updated:\n\n- Added sudo-1-8-27-bsc1201462-ignore-no-sudohost.patch  * Ignore entries when converting LDAP to sudoers.

It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence.
