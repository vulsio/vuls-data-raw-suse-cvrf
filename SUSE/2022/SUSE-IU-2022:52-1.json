This caching mechanism could be abused by\n  an attacker to significantly degrade resolver performance. The\n  vulnerability has been mitigated by changing the default value of\n  lame-ttl to 0 and overriding any explicitly set value with 0,\n  effectively disabling this mechanism altogether. ISC's testing has\n  determined that doing that has a negligible impact on resolver\n  performance while also preventing abuse.\n  Administrators may observe more traffic towards servers issuing\n  certain types of broken responses than in previous BIND 9 releases.\n  [bsc#1192146, CVE-2021-25219, bind-CVE-2021-25219.patch]\n- Fix off-by-one error when calculating new hashtable size\n  When calculating the new hashtable bitsize, there was an off-by-one\n  error that would allow the new bitsize to be larger than maximum allowed\n  causing assertion failure in the rehash() function.\n  [bsc#1188763, 0001-Fix-off-by-one-error-when-calculating-new-hashtable.patch]\n- Since BIND 9.9, it has been easier to use tsig-keygen and\n  ddns-confgen to generare TSIG keys. In 9.13, TSIG support was\n  removed from dnssec-keygen, so now it is just for DNSKEY (and KEY\n  for obscure cases). tsig-keygen is now used to generate DDNS keys.\n  [bsc#1187921, vendor-files.tar.bz2]\n- * A broken inbound incremental zone update (IXFR)\n    can cause named to terminate unexpectedly\n    [CVE-2021-25214, bind-CVE-2021-25214.patch]\n  * An assertion check can fail while answering queries\n    for DNAME records that require the DNAME to be processed to resolve\n    itself\n    [CVE-2021-25215, bind-CVE-2021-25215.patch]\n  * A second vulnerability in BIND's GSSAPI security\n    policy negotiation can be targeted by a buffer overflow attack\n    This does not affect this package as the affected code is\n    disabled.\n    [CVE-2021-25216]\n  [bsc#1185345]\n- pass PIE compiler and linker flags via environment variables to make\n  /usr/bin/delv in bind-tools also position independent (bsc#1183453).\n- drop pie_compile.diff: no longer needed, this patch is difficult to\n  maintain, the environment variable approach is less error prone.\n  [bsc#1183453, bind.spec, pie_compile.diff]\n\nPackage binutils was updated:\n\n- Add binutils-revert-hlasm-insns.diff for compatibility on old  code stream that expect 'brcl 0,label' to not be disassembled\n  as 'jgnop label' on s390x.  [bsc#1192267]\n- Rebase binutils-2.37-branch.diff: fixes PR28523 aka boo#1188941.\n- Fix empty man-pages from broken release tarball [PR28144].\n- Update binutils-skip-rpaths.patch with contained a memory corruption\n  (boo#1191473).\n- Configure with --disable-x86-used-note on old code streams.\n- Disable libalternatives temporarily for build cycle reasons.\n- make TARGET-bfd=headers again, we patch bfd-in.h\n- This state submitted to SLE12 and SLE15 code streams for annual\n  toolchain update. [jsc#PM-2767, jsc#SLE-21561, jsc#SLE-19618]\n- Bump binutils-2.37-branch.diff to 66d5c7003, to include fixes for\n  PR28422, PR28192, PR28391.  Also adds some s390x arch14\n  instructions [jsc#SLE-18637].\n- Using libalternatives instead of update-alternatives.\n- Adjust for testsuite fails on older products that configure\n  binutils in different ways, adds  binutils-compat-old-behaviour.diff\n  and adjusts binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff and\n  binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff.\n- Bump binutils-2.37-branch.diff: fixes PR28138.\n- Use LTO &amp; PGO build.\n- Update to binutils 2.37:\n  * The GNU Binutils sources now requires a C99 compiler and library to\n    build.\n  * Support for the arm-symbianelf format has been removed.\n  * Support for Realm Management Extension (RME) for AArch64 has been\n    added.\n  * A new linker option '-z report-relative-reloc' for x86 ELF targets\n    has been added to report dynamic relative relocations.\n  * A new linker option '-z start-stop-gc' has been added to disable\n    special treatment of __start_*/__stop_* references when\n  - -gc-sections.\n  * A new linker options '-Bno-symbolic' has been added which will\n    cancel the '-Bsymbolic' and '-Bsymbolic-functions' options.\n  * The readelf tool has a new command line option which can be used to\n    specify how the numeric values of symbols are reported.\n  - -sym-base=0|8|10|16 tells readelf to display the values in base 8,\n    base 10 or base 16.  A sym base of 0 represents the default action\n    of displaying values under 10000 in base 10 and values above that in\n    base 16.\n  * A new format has been added to the nm program.  Specifying\n    '--format=just-symbols' (or just using -j) will tell the program to\n    only display symbol names and nothing else.\n  * A new command line option '--keep-section-symbols' has been added to\n    objcopy and strip.  This stops the removal of unused section symbols\n    when the file is copied.  Removing these symbols saves space, but\n    sometimes they are needed by other tools.\n  * The '--weaken', '--weaken-symbol' and '--weaken-symbols' options\n    supported by objcopy now make undefined symbols weak on targets that\n    support weak symbols.\n  * Readelf and objdump can now display and use the contents of .debug_sup\n    sections.\n  * Readelf and objdump will now follow links to separate debug info\n    files by default.  This behaviour can be stopped via the use of the\n    new '-wN' or '--debug-dump=no-follow-links' options for readelf and\n    the '-WN' or '--dwarf=no-follow-links' options for objdump.  Also\n    the old behaviour can be restored by the use of the\n    '--enable-follow-debug-links=no' configure time option.\n    The semantics of the =follow-links option have also been slightly\n    changed.  When enabled, the option allows for the loading of symbol\n    tables and string tables from the separate files which can be used\n    to enhance the information displayed when dumping other sections,\n    but it does not automatically imply that information from the\n    separate files should be displayed.\n    If other debug section display options are also enabled (eg\n    '--debug-dump=info') then the contents of matching sections in both\n    the main file and the separate debuginfo file *will* be displayed.\n    This is because in most cases the debug section will only be present\n    in one of the files.\n    If however non-debug section display options are enabled (eg\n    '--sections') then the contents of matching parts of the separate\n    debuginfo file will *not* be displayed.  This is because in most\n    cases the user probably only wanted to load the symbol information\n    from the separate debuginfo file.  In order to change this behaviour\n    a new command line option --process-links can be used.  This will\n    allow di0pslay options to applied to both the main file and any\n    separate debuginfo files.\n  * Nm has a new command line option: '--quiet'.  This suppresses &quot;/no\n    symbols&quot;/ diagnostic.\n- Includes fixes for these CVEs:\n  bnc#1181452 aka CVE-2021-20197 aka PR26945\n  bnc#1183511 aka CVE-2021-20284 aka PR26931\n  bnc#1184519 aka CVE-2021-20294 aka PR26929\n  bnc#1184620 aka CVE-2021-3487 aka PR26946\n  bnc#1184794 aka CVE-2020-35448 aka PR26574\n- Also fixes:\n  bsc#1183909 - slow performance of stripping some binaries\n- Rebased patches: binutils-build-as-needed.diff, binutils-fix-abierrormsg.diff,\n  binutils-fix-invalid-op-errata.diff, binutils-fix-relax.diff,\n  binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff, binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff\n- Removed patches (are in upstream): ppc-ensure-undef-dynamic-weak-undefined.patch and\n  ppc-use-local-plt.patch.\n- Add binutils-2.37-branch.diff.gz.\n- ppc-ensure-undef-dynamic-weak-undefined.patch: PPC: ensure_undef_dynamic\n  on weak undef only in plt\n- ppc-use-local-plt.patch: PowerPC use_local_plt (prerequisite for above\n  patch)\n- Update 2.36 branch diff which fixes PR27587.\n- Do not run make TARGET-bfd=headers separately.\n- Bump 2.36 branch diff (includes fix for PR27441 aka bsc#1182252).\n- Bump 2.36 branch diff.\n- Update 2.36 branch diff which should fix PR27311 completely.\n  It fixes also PR27284.\n- Remove temporary fix 0001-PR27311-ld.bfd-symbol-from-plugin-undefined-referenc.patch.\n- Add temporary upstream fix for PR27311\n  0001-PR27311-ld.bfd-symbol-from-plugin-undefined-referenc.patch.\n- Update to binutils 2.36:\n  New features in the Assembler:\n    General:\n  * When setting the link order attribute of ELF sections, it is now\n    possible to use a numeric section index instead of symbol name.\n  * Added a .nop directive to generate a single no-op instruction in\n    a target neutral manner.  This instruction does have an effect on\n    DWARF line number generation, if that is active.\n  * Removed --reduce-memory-overheads and --hash-size as gas now\n    uses hash tables that can be expand and shrink automatically.\n    X86/x86_64:\n  * Add support for AVX VNNI, HRESET, UINTR, TDX, AMX and Key\n    Locker instructions.\n  * Support non-absolute segment values for lcall and ljmp.\n  * Add {disp16} pseudo prefix to x86 assembler.\n  * Configure with --enable-x86-used-note by default for Linux/x86.\n    ARM/AArch64:\n  * Add support for Cortex-A78, Cortex-A78AE and Cortex-X1,\n    Cortex-R82, Neoverse V1, and Neoverse N2 cores.\n  * Add support for ETMv4 (Embedded Trace Macrocell), ETE (Embedded\n    Trace Extension), TRBE (Trace Buffer Extension), CSRE (Call\n    Stack Recorder Extension) and BRBE (Branch Record Buffer\n    Extension) system registers.\n  * Add support for Armv8-R and Armv8.7-A ISA extensions.\n  * Add support for DSB memory nXS barrier, WFET and WFIT\n    instruction for Armv8.7.\n  * Add support for +csre feature for -march. Add CSR PDEC\n    instruction for CSRE feature in AArch64.\n  * Add support for +flagm feature for -march in Armv8.4 AArch64.\n  * Add support for +ls64 feature for -march in Armv8.7\n    AArch64. Add atomic 64-byte load/store instructions for this\n    feature.\n  * Add support for +pauth (Pointer Authentication) feature for\n  - march in AArch64.\n    New features in the Linker:\n  * Add --error-handling-script=&lt;NAME&gt; command line option to allow\n    a helper script to be invoked when an undefined symbol or a\n    missing library is encountered.  This option can be suppressed\n    via the configure time switch: --enable-error-handling-script=no.\n  * Add -z x86-64-{baseline|v[234]} to the x86 ELF linker to mark\n    x86-64-{baseline|v[234]} ISA level as needed.\n  * Add -z unique-symbol to avoid duplicated local symbol names.\n  * The creation of PE format DLLs now defaults to using a more\n    secure set of DLL characteristics.\n  * The linker now deduplicates the types in .ctf sections.  The new\n    command-line option --ctf-share-types describes how to do this:\n    its default value, share-unconflicted, produces the most compact\n    output.\n  * The linker now omits the &quot;/variable section&quot;/ from .ctf sections\n    by default, saving space.  This is almost certainly what you\n    want unless you are working on a project that has its own\n    analogue of symbol tables that are not reflected in the ELF\n    symtabs.\n  New features in other binary tools:\n  * The ar tool's previously unused l modifier is now used for\n    specifying dependencies of a static library. The arguments of\n    this option (or --record-libdeps long form option) will be\n    stored verbatim in the __.LIBDEP member of the archive, which\n    the linker may read at link time.\n  * Readelf can now display the contents of LTO symbol table\n    sections when asked to do so via the --lto-syms command line\n    option.\n  * Readelf now accepts the -C command line option to enable the\n    demangling of symbol names.

Applications that depend on\n  exact FAT file format (e. g. embedded systems) may be broken in\n  two ways:\n  * The introduction of the alignment may create smaller images\n    than before, with a different positions of important image\n    elements. It can break existing software that expect images in\n    doststools &lt;= 4.1 style.\n    To work around these problems, use &quot;/-a&quot;/ command line argument.\n  * The new image may contain a different geometry values. Geometry\n    sensitive applications expecting doststools &lt;= 4.1 style images\n    can fails to accept different geometry values.\n    There is no direct work around for this problem. But you can\n    take the old image, use &quot;/file -s $IMAGE&quot;/, check its\n    &quot;/sectors/track&quot;/ and &quot;/heads&quot;/, and use them in the newly\n    introduced &quot;/-g&quot;/ command line argument.\n- Add fix-calculation.patch (gh#dosfstools/dosfstools#153, bsc#1172863)\n  to work with different size of clusters.\n\nPackage e2fsprogs was updated:\n\nPackage efibootmgr was updated:\n\nPackage efivar was updated:\n\n- Add efivar-bsc1187386-fix-emmc-parsing.patch to fix the eMMC  sysfs parsing (bsc#1187386)\n- Add efivar-bsc1181967-fix-nvme-parsing.patch to fix the NVME\n  path parsing (bsc#1181967)\n\nPackage expat was updated:\n\n- Security fix (CVE-2021-45960, bsc#1194251)  * A left shift by 29 (or more) places in the storeAtts function\n    in xmlparse.c can lead to realloc misbehavior.\n  * Added expat-CVE-2021-45960.patch\n- Security fix (CVE-2021-46143, bsc#1194362)\n  * Integer overflow exists for m_groupSize in doProlog\n  * Added expat-CVE-2021-46143.patch\n- Security fix (CVE-2022-22822, bsc#1194474)\n  * Integer overflow in addBinding in xmlparse.c\n  * Added expat-CVE-2022-22822.patch\n- Security fix (CVE-2022-22823, bsc#1194476)\n  * Integer overflow in build_model in xmlparse.c\n  * Added expat-CVE-2022-22823.patch\n- Security fix (CVE-2022-22824, bsc#1194477)\n  * Integer overflow in defineAttribute in xmlparse.c\n  * Added expat-CVE-2022-22824.patch\n- Security fix (CVE-2022-22825, bsc#1194478)\n  * Integer overflow in lookup in xmlparse.c\n  * Added expat-CVE-2022-22825.patch\n- Security fix (CVE-2022-22826, bsc#1194479)\n  * Integer overflow in nextScaffoldPart in xmlparse.c\n  * Added expat-CVE-2022-22826.patch\n- Security fix (CVE-2022-22827, bsc#1194480)\n  * Integer overflow in storeAtts in xmlparse.c\n  * Added expat-CVE-2022-22826.patch\n- Refresh expat-CVE-2018-20843.patch as a p1 patch.\n- Use %autosetup macro\n\nPackage expect was updated:\n\n- bsc#1183904, expect-errorfd.patch:  errorfd file descriptors should be closed when forking\n- fix previous change regarding PIE linking. Passing SHLIB_CFLAGS=&quot;/-shared&quot;/\n  causes /usr/bin/expect to become a shared library that SEGFAULTs upon\n  execution. Instead use SHLIB_LD to pass -shared only to shared library\n  linking.\n- pass explicit -pie flag to CFLAGS and hack `make` invocation so that\n  /usr/bin/expect actually becomes a PIE binary.

This patch fixes the problem.\n- Require a minimum number of mirrors for multicurl (bsc#1191609)\n- Use procfs to detect nr of open fd's if rlimit is too high\n  (bsc#1191324)\n  Especially in a VM iterating over all possible fd's to close open\n  ones right before a exec() slows down zypper unnecessarily. This\n  patch uses /proc/self/fd to iterate over open fd's in case rlimit\n  is above 1024.\n- po: Fix some lost '%' signs in positional args (bsc#1191370)\n- RepoManager: Don't probe for plaindir repo if URL schema is\n  plugin: (bsc#1191286)\n- version 17.28.6 (22)\n- Downloader does not respect checkExistsOnly flag (bsc#1190712)\n  A missing check causes zyppng::Downloader to always download full\n  files even if the checkExistsOnly flag is set. This patch adds\n  the missing logic.\n- Fix kernel-*-livepatch removal in purge-kernels (bsc#1190815)\n  The kernel-*-livepatch packages are supposed to serve as a stable\n  handle for the ephemeral kernel livepatch packages. See\n  FATE#320268 for details. As part of the kernel live patching\n  ecosystem, kernel-*-livepatch packages should not block the\n  purge-kernels step.\n- version 17.28.5 (22)\n- Make sure to keep states alives while transitioning\n  (bsc#1190199)\n- May set techpreview variables for testing in /etc/zypp/zypp.conf.\n  If environment variables are unhandy one may enable the desired\n  techpreview in zypp.conf as well:\n    [main]\n    techpreview.ZYPP_SINGLE_RPMTRANS=1\n    techpreview.ZYPP_MEDIANETWORK=1\n- version 17.28.4 (22)\n- CMake/spec: Add option to force SINGLE_RPMTRANS as default for\n  zypper (fixes #340)\n- Make sure singleTrans is zypper-only for now.\n- Do not double check signatures and keys (bsc#1190059)\n- version 17.28.3 (22)\n- Workaround Bug 1189788: Don't allow ZYPP_SINGLE_RPMTRANS=1 on a\n  not UsrMerged Tumbleweed system.\n- version 17.28.2 (22)\n- Fix crashes in logging code when shutting down (bsc#1189031)\n- version 17.28.1 (22)\n- Rephrase vendor conflict message in case 2 packages are\n  involved (bsc#1187760)\n  This covers the case where not the packages itself would change\n  its vendor, but replaces a package from a different vendor.\n- Fix solver jobs for PTFs (bsc#1186503)\n- spec: switch to pkgconfig(openssl)\n- Show key fpr from signature when signature check fails\n  (bsc#1187224)\n  Rpm by default only shows the short key ID when checking the\n  signature of a package fails. This patch reads the signatures\n  from the RPM headers and replaces she short IDs with the key\n  fingerprints fetched from the signatures.\n- Implement alternative single transaction commit strategy.\n  This patch adds a experimental commit strategy that runs all\n  operations in a single rpm transaction, speeding up the execution\n  a lot.\n- Use ZYPP_MEDIANETWORK=1 to enable the experimental new media\n  backend.\n- Implement zchunk download, refactor Downloader backend.\n- Fix purge-kernels fails with kernels from Kernel:HEAD\n  (bsc#1187738)\n  There recently was a change in the kernel package naming scheme\n  in regards to rc kernels. Since kernel upstream uses characters\n  in the version that are not allowed in rpm versions a &quot;/-rc&quot;/ was\n  previously replaced with &quot;/.rc&quot;/ which broke sorting by version, to\n  fix this issue it was replaced with &quot;/~rc&quot;/, which unfortunately\n  broke the purge-kernels logic. This patch makes sure purge-kernel\n  does apply the same conversion.\n- version 17.28.0 (22)\n- Enhance XML output of repo GPG options (fixes openSUSE/zypper#390)\n  In addition to the effective values, add optional attributes\n  showing the raw values actually present in the .repo file.\n  (raw_gpgcheck, raw_repo_gpgcheck, raw_pkg_gpgcheck)\n- Link all executables with -pie (bsc#1186447)\n- Ship an empty /etc/zypp/needreboot per default (fixes #311, jsc#PM-2645)\n  If packages want to trigger the reboot-needed hiint upon installation\n  they may provide 'installhint(reboot-needed)'.\n  Builtin packages triggering the hint without the provides are\n  only kernel and kernel-firmware related.\n- Add Solvable::isBlacklisted as superset of retracted and ptf\n  packages (bsc#1186503)\n- Fix segv if ZYPP_FULLOG is set (fixes #317)\n- version 17.27.0 (22)\n- Work around download.o.o broken https redirects.\n- Allow trusted repos to add additional signing keys (bsc#1184326)\n  Repositories signed with a trusted gpg key may import additional\n  package signing keys.

Fixes\n  * A subtraction of two numbers of the same sign or addition of two\n    numbers of different signs can be rounded incorrectly (and the\n    ternary value can be incorrect) when one of the two inputs is\n    reused as the output (destination) and all these MPFR numbers\n    have exactly GMP_NUMB_BITS bits of precision (typically, 32 bits\n    on 32-bit machines, 64 bits on 64-bit machines).\n  * The mpfr_fma and mpfr_fms functions can behave incorrectly in case\n    of internal overflow or underflow.\n  * The result of the mpfr_sqr function can be rounded incorrectly\n    in a rare case near underflow when the destination has exactly\n    GMP_NUMB_BITS bits of precision (typically, 32 bits on 32-bit\n    machines, 64 bits on 64-bit machines) and the input has at most\n    GMP_NUMB_BITS bits of precision.\n  * The behavior and documentation of the mpfr_get_str function are\n    inconsistent concerning the minimum precision (this is related to\n    the change of the minimum precision from 2 to 1 in MPFR 4.0.0). The\n    get_str patch fixes this issue in the following way: the value 1\n    can now be provided for n (4th argument of mpfr_get_str); if n = 0,\n    then the number of significant digits in the output string can now\n    be 1, as already implied by the documentation (but the code was\n    increasing it to 2).\n  * The mpfr_cmp_q function can behave incorrectly when the rational\n    (mpq_t) number has a null denominator.\n  * The mpfr_inp_str and mpfr_out_str functions might behave\n    incorrectly when the stream is a null pointer: the stream is\n    replaced by stdin and stdout, respectively. This behavior is\n    useless, not documented (thus incorrect in case a null pointer\n    would have a special meaning), and not consistent with other\n    input/output functions.\n\nPackage ncurses was updated:\n\n- Add patch bsc1190793-63ca9e06.patch to fix bsc#1190793 for  CVE-2021-39537: ncurses: heap-based buffer overflow in\n  _nc_captoinfo in captoinfo.c\n\nPackage netcfg was updated:\n\n- add submissions port number [bsc#1189683]- modified patches\n  % services-suse.diff\n\nPackage nfs-utils was updated:\n\n- Add 0019-gssd-use-mutex-to-protect-decrement-of-refcount.patch  A field was modified by multiple threads without locking.\n  This can lead to use-after-free.\n  (bsc#1183194)\n- Add 0018-Replace-all-var-run-with-run.patch\n  /var/run is long deprecated -

(bsc#1172974, CVE-2020-14155)\n  * Tidy up left shifts to avoid sanitize warnings; also fix one NULL deference\n  in pcretest.\n- pcre 8.43\n  * In a pattern such as /[^x{100}-x{ffff}]*[x80-xff]/ which has a repeated\n  negative class with no characters less than 0x100 followed by a positive class\n  with only characters less than 0x100, the first class was incorrectly being\n  auto-possessified, causing incorrect match failures.\n  * If the only branch in a conditional subpattern was anchored, the whole\n  subpattern was treated as anchored, when it should not have been, since the\n  assumed empty second branch cannot be anchored. Demonstrated by test patterns\n  such as /(?(1)^())b/ or /(?(?=^))b/.\n  * Fix subject buffer overread in JIT when UTF is disabled and X or R has\n  a greater than 1 fixed quantifier. This issue was found by Yunho Kim.\n  (bsc#1172973 CVE-2019-20838)\n  * If a pattern started with a subroutine call that had a quantifier with a\n  minimum of zero, an incorrect &quot;/match must start with this character&quot;/ could be\n  recorded. Example: /(?&amp;xxx)*ABC(?&lt;xxx&gt;XYZ)/ would (incorrectly) expect 'A' to\n  be the first character of a match.\n- pcre 8.42\n  * If a backreference with a minimum repeat count of zero was first in a\n  pattern, apart from assertions, an incorrect first matching character could be\n  recorded. For example, for the pattern /(?=(a))1?b/, &quot;/b&quot;/ was incorrectly set\n  as the first character of a match.\n  * Fix out-of-bounds read for partial matching of /./ against an empty string\n  when the newline type is CRLF.\n  * When matching using the the REG_STARTEND feature of the POSIX API with a\n  non-zero starting offset, unset capturing groups with lower numbers than a\n  group that did capture something were not being correctly returned as &quot;/unset&quot;/\n  (that is, with offset values of -1).\n  * Matching the pattern /(*UTF)C[^v]+x80/ against an 8-bit string\n  containing multi-code-unit characters caused bad behaviour and possibly a\n  crash. This issue was fixed for other kinds of repeat in release 8.37 by change\n  38, but repeating character classes were overlooked.\n- Do not run profiling 'check' in parallel\n  to make package build reproducible (boo#1040589)\n\nPackage pcre2 was updated:\n\n- Added 0001-Fixed-atomic-group-backtracking-bug.patch  * bsc#1187937\n  * PHP 7.6.4 on s390x returns different results for preg_match\n    function as compared to older PHP versions and x86\n  * Sourced from upstream subversion commit:\n    $ svn log -r965 svn://vcs.pcre.org/pcre2/code/trunk\n\nPackage pixman was updated:\n\nPackage polkit was updated:\n\n- CVE-2021-4034: fixed a local privilege escalation in pkexec (bsc#1194568)  added CVE-2021-4034-pkexec-fix.patch\n- CVE-2021-3560: fixed a local privilege escalation using polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync()\n  (bsc#1186497)\n  CVE-2021-3560.patch\n\nPackage procps was updated:\n\n- Add upstream patch procps-vmstat-1b9ea611.patch for bsc#1185417  * Support up to 2048 CPU as well\n- Add upstream patch procps-3.3.17-bsc1181976.patch based on\n  commit 3dd1661a to fix bsc#1181976 that is change descripton\n  of psr, which is for 39th field of /proc/[pid]/stat\n\nPackage psmisc was updated:\n\n- Change patch 0001-Use-mountinfo-to-be-able-to-use-the-mount-identity.patch  * Fix bsc#1185208 to make private mount namespaces work as well\n    as to distinguish NFS mounts from same remote device share.\n- Change patch 0001-Use-mountinfo-to-be-able-to-use-the-mount-identity.patch\n  * Fix bsc#1178407: fuser does not show open kvm storage image files\n    such as qcow2 files.

The ReDoS-vulnerable\n    regex has quadratic worst-case complexity and it allows cause\n    a denial of service when identifying crafted invalid RFCs. This\n    ReDoS issue is on the client side and needs remote attackers to\n    control the HTTP server.\n- Upstreamed patches were removed:\n  - CVE-2021-3426-inf-disclosure-pydoc-getfile.patch\n- Refreshed patches:\n  - python3-sorted_tar.patch\n  - riscv64-ctypes.patch\n- Rebuild to get new headers, avoid building in support for\n  stropts.h (bsc#1187338).\n- Use versioned python-Sphinx to avoid dependency on other\n  version of Python (bsc#1183858).\n- Modify Lib/ensurepip/__init__.py to contain the same version\n  numbers as are in reality the ones in the bundled wheels\n  (bsc#1187668).\n- add 22198.patch to build with Sphinx 4\n- Stop providing &quot;/python&quot;/ symbol (bsc#1185588), which means\n  python2 currently.\n- Make sure to close the import_failed.map file after the exception\n  has been raised in order to avoid ResourceWarnings when the\n  failing import is part of a try...except block.\n- Add CVE-2021-3426-inf-disclosure-pydoc-getfile.patch to remove\n  getfile feature from pydoc, which is a security nightmare\n  (among other things, CVE-2021-3426, allows disclosure of any\n  file on the system; bsc#1183374, bpo#42988).\nUpdate to 3.6.13, final release of 3.6 branch:\n  * Security\n  - bpo#42967 (bsc#1182379, CVE-2021-23336): Fix web cache\n    poisoning vulnerability by defaulting the query args\n    separator to &amp;, and allowing the user to choose a custom\n    separator.\n  - bpo#42938 (bsc#1181126, CVE-2021-3177): Avoid static\n    buffers when computing the repr of ctypes.c_double and\n    ctypes.c_longdouble values.\n  - bpo#42103: Prevented potential DoS attack via CPU and RAM\n    exhaustion when processing malformed Apple Property List\n    files in binary format.\n  - bpo#42051: The plistlib module no longer accepts entity\n    declarations in XML plist files to avoid XML\n    vulnerabilities.

Conditionals in the roff source are now used\n    instead. This fixes corruption of the sudo manual on systems without BSD\n    login classes. Bug #861.\n  * If an I/O logging plugin is configured but the plugin does not actually\n    log any I/O, sudo will no longer force the command to be run in a pseudo-tty.\n  * In visudo, it is now possible to specify the path to sudoers without\n    using the -f option. Bug #864.\n  * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.22 where the utmp (or utmpx) file\n    would not be updated when a command was run in a pseudo-tty. Bug #865.\n  * Sudo now sets the silent flag when opening the PAM session except when\n    running a shell via sudo -s or sudo -i. This prevents the pam_lastlog\n    module from printing the last login information for each sudo command.\n    Bug #867.\n  - Major changes between version 1.8.26 and 1.8.25p1:\n  * Fixed a bug in cvtsudoers when converting to JSON format when alias\n    expansion is enabled. Bug #853.\n  * Sudo no long sets the USERNAME environment variable when running\n    commands. This is a non-standard environment variable that was set on\n    some older Linux systems.\n  * Sudo now treats the LOGNAME and USER environment variables (as well as\n    the LOGIN variable on AIX) as a single unit. If one is preserved or removed\n    from the environment using env_keep, env_check or env_delete, so is the\n    other.\n  * Added support for OpenLDAP's TLS_REQCERT setting in ldap.conf.\n  * Sudo now logs when the command was suspended and resumed in the I/O logs.\n    This information is used by sudoreplay to skip the time suspended when\n    replaying the session unless the new -S flag is used.\n  * Fixed documentation problems found by the igor utility. Bug #854.\n  * Sudo now prints a warning message when there is an error or end of file\n    while reading the password instead of exiting silently.\n  * Fixed a bug in the sudoers LDAP back-end parsing the command_timeout,\n    role, type, privs and limitprivs sudoOptions. This also affected cvtsudoers\n    conversion from LDIF to sudoers or JSON.\n  * Fixed a bug that prevented timeout settings in sudoers from functioning\n    unless a timeout was also specified on the command line.\n  * Asturian translation for sudo from translationproject.org.\n  * When generating LDIF output, cvtsudoers can now be configured to pad the\n    sudoOrder increment such that the start order is used as a prefix. Bug #856.\n  * If the user specifies a group via sudo's -g option that matches any of\n    the target user's groups, it is now allowed even if no groups are present\n    in the Runas_Spec. Previously, it was only allowed if it matched the target\n    user's primary group.\n  * The sudoers LDAP back-end now supports negated sudoRunAsUser and\n    sudoRunAsGroup entries.\n  * Sudo now provides a proper error message when the &quot;/fqdn&quot;/ sudoers option\n    is set and it is unable to resolve the local host name. Bug #859.\n  * Portuguese translation for sudo and sudoers from translationproject.org.\n  * Sudo now includes sudoers LDAP schema for the on-line configuration\n    supported by OpenLDAP.\n  - Major changes between version 1.8.25p1 and 1.8.25:\n  * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.25 that caused a crash on systems that\n    have the poll() function but not the ppoll() function. Bug #851.\n  - Major changes between version 1.8.25 and 1.8.24:\n  * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.20 that broke formatting of I/O log\n    timing file entries on systems without a C99-compatible snprintf()\n    function. Our replacement snprintf() doesn't support floating point so we\n    can't use the %f format directive.\n  * I/O log timing file entries now use a monotonic timer and include\n    nanosecond precision. A monotonic timer that does not increment while the\n    system is sleeping is used where available.\n  * When sudo runs a command in a pseudo-tty, the slave device is now closed\n    in the main process immediately after starting the monitor process. This\n    removes the need for an AIX-specific workaround that was added in sudo 1.8.24.\n  * Fixed a bug displaying timeout values the &quot;/sudo -V&quot;/ output. The value\n    displayed was 3600 times the actual value. Bug #846.\n  * The testsudoers utility now supports querying an LDIF-format policy.\n  * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.24 where the LDAP and SSSD\n    backends evaluated the rules in reverse sudoOrder. Bug #849.\n  - Major changes between version 1.8.24 and 1.8.23:\n  * The LDAP and SSS back-ends now use the same rule evaluation code as the\n    sudoers file backend. This builds on the work in sudo 1.8.23 where the\n    formatting functions for sudo -l output were shared. The handling of\n    negated commands in SSS and LDAP is unchanged.\n  * Fixed a regression introduced in 1.8.23 where sudo -i could not be used\n    in conjunction with --preserve-env=VARIABLE. Bug #835.\n  * cvtsudoers can now parse base64-encoded attributes in LDIF files.\n  * Random insults are now more random.\n  * Added SUDO_CONV_PREFER_TTY flag for conversation function to tell sudo to\n    try writing to /dev/tty first. Can be used in conjunction with SUDO_CONV_\n    INFO_MSG and SUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG.\n  * Fixed typos in the OpenLDAP sudo schema. Bugs #839 and #840. Bug #839 and\n    bug #840.\n  * Fixed a race condition when building with parallel make. Bug #842.\n  * Fixed a duplicate free when netgroup_base in ldap.conf is set to an\n    invalid value.\n  * On systems using PAM, sudo now ignores the PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD and\n    PAM_AUTHTOK_EXPIRED errors from PAM account management if authentication is\n    disabled for the user. This fixes a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.23.\n    Bug #843.\n  * Fixed an ambiguity in the sudoers manual in the description and\n    definition of User, Runas, Host, and Cmnd Aliases. Bug #834.\n  * Fixed a bug that resulted in only the first window size change event\n    being logged.\n  * Fixed a compilation problem on systems that define O_PATH or O_SEARCH in\n    fnctl.h but do not define O_DIRECTORY. Bug #844.\n  - Major changes between version 1.8.23 and 1.8.22:\n  * PAM account management modules and BSD auth approval modules are now run\n    even when no password is required.\n  * For kernel-based time stamps, if no terminal is present, fall back to\n    parent-pid style time stamps.\n  * The new cvtsudoers utility replaces both the sudoers2ldif script and the\n    visudo -x functionality. It can read a file in either sudoers or LDIF\n    format and produce JSON, LDIF or sudoers output. It is also possible to\n    filter the generated output file by user, group or host name.\n  * The file, ldap and sss sudoers backends now share a common set of\n    formatting functions for &quot;/sudo -l&quot;/ output, which is also used by the\n    cvtsudoers utility.\n  * The /run directory is now used in preference to /var/run if it exists.\n    Bug #822.\n  * More accurate descriptions of the --with-rundir and --with-vardir\n    configure options. Bug #823.\n  * The setpassent() and setgroupent() functions are now used on systems that\n    support them to keep the passwd and group database open. Sudo performs a\n    lot of passwd and group lookups so it can be beneficial to avoid opening\n    and closing the files each time.\n  * The new case_insensitive_user and case_insensitive_group sudoers options\n    can be used to control whether sudo does case-sensitive matching of users\n    and groups in sudoers. Case insensitive matching is now the default.\n  * Fixed a bug on some systems where sudo could hang on command exit when\n    I/O logging was enabled. Bug #826.\n  * Fixed a problem with the process start time test in make check when run\n    in a Linux container. The test now uses the &quot;/btime&quot;/ field in /proc/stat to\n    get the system start time instead of using /proc/uptime, which is the\n    container uptime. Bug #829.\n  * When determining which temporary directory to use, sudoedit now checks\n    the directory for writability before using it. Previously, sudoedit only\n    performed an existence check. Bug #827.\n  * Sudo now includes an optional set of Monty Python-inspired insults.\n  * Chinese (Taiwan) translation for sudo from translationproject.org.\n- Tenable Scan reports sudo is still vulnerable to CVE-2021-3156\n  [bsc#1183936]\n- Add sudo-1.8.27-ipa_hostname.patch to fix special handling of\n  ipa_hostname that was lost in sudo 1.8.24.\n  We now include the long and short hostname in sudo parser container\n  [bsc#1181371]\n- Restore sudo ldap behavior to ignore expire dates when SUDOERS_TIMED\n  option is not set in /etc/ldap.conf\n  * [bsc#1176473]\n  * Added sudo-1.8.27-ldap-respect-SUDOERS_TIMED.patch\n    From: https://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/d1e1bb5a6cc1\n\nPackage supportutils was updated:\n\n- Changes to version 3.1.17  + Adding ethtool options g

Now it enables also the\n  user services installed before this package, thus fixing\n  boo#1186561\n- Enable hcn-init.service for HNV on POWER (bsc#1184136 ltc#192155).\n- Enable user service pipewire-media-session.service (used with\n  pipewire &gt;= 0.3.23).\n- Enable user services pipewire.socket and pipewire-pulse.socket\n  (boo#1183012).\n- Enable btrfsmaintenance-refresh.path and disable\n  btrfsmaintenance-refresh.service to avoid needless refresh on boot\n  (boo#1165780)\n- Enable dnf-makecache.timer\n- BuildRequire pkgconfig(systemd) instead of systemd: allow OBS to\n  shortcut the build queues by allowing usage of systemd-mini\n- Enable ignition-firstboot-complete.service\n- Enable logwatch.timer (bsc#1112500).\n- Recent versions of mlocate don't use updatedb.timer any more.\n  Instead, the unit is called mlocate.timer. [boo#1115408]\n- Add default user preset: currently containing only the new\n  pulseaudio.socket (bsc#1083473)\n\nPackage systemd-rpm-macros was updated:\n\n- Bump version to 9- Introduce %_systemd_util_dir\n  It's a backport of upstream commit 3bc66bfa0136e370a8f7b06c3b69a52f5636ef82.\n- Bump to version 8\n- Make use of &quot;/Suggests:&quot;/ in %systemd_ordering\n  Until libzypp supports &quot;/OrderWithRequires:&quot;/, we need to specify a\n  similar ordering constraint that can be understood by the dep solver\n  as well. Hence the use of &quot;/Suggests:&quot;/ in %systemd_ordering\n  (workaround for bsc#1187332).\n- Introduce %sysusers_create_package\n  %sysusers_create and %sysusers_create_inline are now deprecated and\n  the new macro should be used instead.\n  Upstream commit 07a7d4a0040d221ff09e527e91c112b4ffab1dba.\n- %sysusers_create_inline: use here-docs instead of echo (bsc#1186282)\n  Upstream commit dd2490ae12ad1e1795ecbf8f8944b950da9c8d06.\n- Bump to version 7\n- Remove confusing --user before --global in %systemd_user_preun\n  It's actually a backport of upstream commit\n  28d36da64a7a23a55e8d0a139f2620384fd058b3\n- Update a few comments\n- Don't pass -f to rm to make sure that rm failures will be logged\n  But also make sure to not abort the scriptlet prematurely if rm\n  fails.\n- Add a %systemd_user_pre macro (boo#1183051, boo#1183012)\n  It creates a /run/systemd/rpm/needs-user-preset/$service file for\n  each new service being installed so %systemd_user_post can call\n  `systemctl --global preset $service` properly for newly installed\n  user services (even when it's introduced via a package update).\n- Fix %systemd_user_post (boo#1183051, boo#1182661)\n  The --global parameter was handled as if it was another service name\n  so %systemd_user_post wasn't working properly. Replace\n  %systemd_user_post with the code from %service_add_post it was being\n  expanded to but correctly passing --global to systemctl.\n- Tabify %service_del_postun_without_restart\n  To make it consistent with the other macros.\n  No functional change.\n- Bump to version 6\n- Make upstream %systemd_{pre,post,preun,postun} aliases to their SUSE\n  counterparts\n  Packagers can now choose to use the upstream or the SUSE variants\n  indifferently. For consistency the SUSE variants should be preferred\n  since almost all SUSE packages already use them but the upstream\n  versions might be usefull in certain cases where packages need to\n  support multiple distros based on RPM.\n- Improve the logic used to apply the presets (bsc#1177039)\n  Before presests were applied at a) package installation b) new units\n  introduced via a package update (but after making sure that it was\n  not a SysV initscript being converted).\n  The problem is that a) didn't handle package a renaming or split\n  properly since the package with the new name is installed rather\n  being updated and therefore the presets were applied even if they\n  were already with the old name.\n  We now cover this case (and the other ones) by applying presets only\n  if the units are new and the services are not being migrated. This\n  regardless of whether this happens during an install or an update.\n\nPackage tar was updated:\n\n- Link /var/lib/tests/tar/bin/genfile as Position-Independent Executable  (bsc#1184124).\n  + tar-PIE.patch\n- security update\n- added patches\n  fix CVE-2021-20193 [bsc#1181131], Memory leak in read_header() in list.c\n  + tar-CVE-2021-20193.patch\n\nPackage tcpdump was updated:\n\n- Disable 5 regression tests that fail with libpcap &gt; 1.8.1  * These test pcap files have been updated in later versions:\n    arp-too-long-tha, juniper_header-heapoverflow,\n    tftp-heapoverflow, relts-0x80000000, stp-v4-length-sigsegv.\n- Add tcpdump-disable-failing-tests.patch [bsc#1183800]\n\nPackage tcsh was updated:\n\n- Add patch tcsh-6.20.00-toolong.patch which is an upstream commit  ported back to 6.20.00 to fix bsc#1179316 about history file growing\n\nPackage telnet was updated:\n\nPackage thin-provisioning-tools was updated:\n\nPackage tigervnc was updated:\n\n- tigervnc-FIPS-use-RFC7919.patch  * Enable GnuTLS 3.6.0 and later to use Diffie-Hellman parameters\n    from RFC7919 instead of generating our own, for FIPS compliance.\n  * Specify RFC7919 parameters for GnuTLS older than 3.6.0.\n  * bsc#1179809\n\nPackage timezone was updated:\n\n- timezone update 2021e (bsc#1177460):  * Palestine will fall back 10-29 (not 10-30) at 01:00\n- timezone update 2021d:\n  * Fiji suspends DST for the 2021/2022 season\n  * 'zic -r' marks unspecified timestamps with &quot;/-00&quot;/\n- timezone update 2021c:\n  * Revert almost all of 2021b's changes to the 'backward' file\n  * Fix a bug in 'zic -b fat' that caused old timestamps to be\n    mishandled in 32-bit-only readers\n- timezone update 2021b:\n  * Jordan now starts DST on February's last Thursday.\n  * Samoa no longer observes DST.\n  * Move some backward-compatibility links to 'backward'.\n  * Rename Pacific/Enderbury to Pacific/Kanton.\n  * Correct many pre-1993 transitions in Malawi, Portugal, etc.\n  * zic now creates each output file or link atomically.\n  * zic -L no longer omits the POSIX TZ string in its output.\n  * zic fixes for truncation and leap second table expiration.\n  * zic now follows POSIX for TZ strings using all-year DST.\n  * Fix some localtime crashes and bugs in obscure cases.\n  * zdump -v now outputs more-useful boundary cases.\n  * tzfile.5 better matches a draft successor to RFC 8536.\n- Refresh tzdata-china.patch\n- Install tzdata.zi (bsc#1188127)\n\nPackage tuned was updated:\n\n- bsc#1191341  Tuned: latency-performance profile configures cpu max-cstates to POLL instead of C1\n  Fixed by mainline commit:\n  latency-peformance: backup latency requirement increased to 3 us\n  A set_force_latency_C1.patch\n\nPackage util-linux was updated:\n\n- Update to version 2.33.2 to provide seamless update  from SLE12 SP5 to SLE15 SP2:\n  * agetty: Fix 8-bit processing in get_logname() (bsc#1125886).\n  * mount: Fix &quot;/mount&quot;/ output for net file systems (bsc#1122417).\n  * Many Other fixes, see\n    https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.33/v2.33.2-ReleaseNotes\n  * obsoletes util-linux-agetty-smart-reload-13.patch,\n    util-linux-agetty-smart-reload-14.patch.\n  * ported util-linux-libmount-pseudofs.patch\n- ipcutils: Avoid potential memory allocation overflow\n  (bsc#1188921, CVE-2021-37600,\n  util-linux-ipcutils-overflow-CVE-2021-37600.patch).\n- Fix ipcs testsuite (bsc#1178236#c19,\n  util-linux-ipcs-shmall-overflow-ts.patch).\n- ipcs: Avoid overflows (bsc#1178236,\n  util-linux-ipcs-shmall-overflow-1.patch,\n  util-linux-ipcs-shmall-overflow-2.patch).\n\nPackage util-linux-systemd was updated:\n\n- Update to version 2.33.2 to provide seamless update  from SLE12 SP5 to SLE15 SP2:\n  * agetty: Fix 8-bit processing in get_logname() (bsc#1125886).\n  * mount: Fix &quot;/mount&quot;/ output for net file systems (bsc#1122417).\n  * Many Other fixes, see\n    https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.33/v2.33.2-ReleaseNotes\n  * obsoletes util-linux-agetty-smart-reload-13.patch,\n    util-linux-agetty-smart-reload-14.patch.\n  * ported util-linux-libmount-pseudofs.patch\n- ipcutils: Avoid potential memory allocation overflow\n  (bsc#1188921, CVE-2021-37600,\n  util-linux-ipcutils-overflow-CVE-2021-37600.patch).\n- Fix ipcs testsuite (bsc#1178236#c19,\n  util-linux-ipcs-shmall-overflow-ts.patch).\n- ipcs: Avoid overflows (bsc#1178236,\n  util-linux-ipcs-shmall-overflow-1.patch,\n  util-linux-ipcs-shmall-overflow-2.patch).\n\nPackage vim was updated:\n\n- install suse vimrc in /usr (boo#1182324, vim-8.0.1568-globalvimrc.patch)- source correct suse.vimrc file (boo#1182324)\n  doesn't leave not owned directories (boo#1173256).\n  build against Tumbleweed repo.\n\nPackage virt-what was updated:\n\n- update to 1.21:  * Nutanix Acropolis Hypervisor detection\n  * podman detection\n- Add &quot;/which&quot;/ to Requires\n  * Fixes boo#1161850, bsc#1176132\n- Version bump 1.20.

When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.",

In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a buffer over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users, we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.",

From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be improperly deleted.",

Unfortunately, when running in PV mode, the Linux backend drivers mishandle this: Some errors are ignored, effectively implying their success from the success of related batch elements. In other cases, errors resulting from one batch element lead to further batch elements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be possible to properly unmap upon error recovery. Only systems with Linux backends running in PV mode are vulnerable. Linux backends run in HVM / PVH modes are not vulnerable. This affects arch/*/xen/p2m.c and drivers/xen/gntdev.c.",

					"text": "ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).",

When containers included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as setuid), unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify those files. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.4.11 and containerd 1.5.7. Users should update to these version when they are released and may restart containers or update directory permissions to mitigate the vulnerability. Users unable to update should limit access to the host to trusted users. Update directory permission on container bundles directories.",
