(bsc#1174353, bsc#1178107)\n- 4.2.91\n\nPackage yast2-packager was updated:\n\n- Show correct number of downloaded packages in log (bsc#1180278)- 4.2.69\n- Fix crash when installation proposal require pattern and such\n  pattern is not available in any repository (found during testing\n  jsc#SLE-17427)\n- 4.2.68\n\nPackage yast2-security was updated:\n\n- Move SELinux .autorelabel file from / to /etc/selinux if root  filesystem will be mounted as read only (jsc#SLE-17307).\n- 4.2.19\n- AutoYaST: add support for SELinux configuration (jsc#SMO-20,\n  jsc#SLE-17342).\n- 4.2.18\n- Avoid crashing when the SELinux configuration file does not\n  exist yet (jsc#SMO-20, jsc#SLE-17342).\n- 4.2.17\n- Improve the class for handling the SELinux configuration.\n- Saves the SELinux mode in the configuration file (jsc#SMO-20,\n  jsc#SLE-17342).\n- 4.2.16\n- Add class for managing SELinux configuration at boot time\n  (jsc#SMO-20, jsc#SLE-17342).\n- 4.2.15\n\nPackage yast2-storage-ng was updated:\n\n- Improved mechanism to detect whether _netdev is needed for a  given disk: use its driver as extra criterion (bsc#1176140).\n- 4.2.115\n\nPackage yast2-update was updated:\n\n- Do not rely on the 'installation-helper' binary to create  snapshots after installation or offline upgrade (bsc#1180142).\n- Do not crash when it is not possible to create a snapshot before\n  upgrading the system (related to bsc#1180142).\n- 4.2.21\n\n",

					"text": "In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before version 1.2.14 there is a credential leaking vulnerability. If a container image manifest in the OCI Image format or Docker Image V2 Schema 2 format includes a URL for the location of a specific image layer (otherwise known as a “foreign layer”), the default containerd resolver will follow that URL to attempt to download it. In v1.2.x but not 1.3.0 or later, the default containerd resolver will provide its authentication credentials if the server where the URL is located presents an HTTP 401 status code along with registry-specific HTTP headers. If an attacker publishes a public image with a manifest that directs one of the layers to be fetched from a web server they control and they trick a user or system into pulling the image, they can obtain the credentials used for pulling that image. In some cases, this may be the user's username and password for the registry. In other cases, this may be the credentials attached to the cloud virtual instance which can grant access to other cloud resources in the account. The default containerd resolver is used by the cri-containerd plugin (which can be used by Kubernetes), the ctr development tool, and other client programs that have explicitly linked against it. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.2.14. containerd 1.3 and later are not affected. If you are using containerd 1.3 or later, you are not affected. If you are using cri-containerd in the 1.2 series or prior, you should ensure you only pull images from trusted sources. Other container runtimes built on top of containerd but not using the default resolver (such as Docker) are not affected.",

					"text": "containerd is an industry-standard container runtime and is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. In containerd before versions 1.3.9 and 1.4.3, the containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host network containers. Access controls for the shim’s API socket verified that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users should update to these versions as soon as they are released. It should be noted that containers started with an old version of containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, as running containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade. If you are not providing the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the same network namespace as the shim (typically the \"host\" network namespace, for example with docker run --net=host or hostNetwork: true in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an effective UID of 0, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are running containers with a vulnerable configuration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets with AppArmor by adding a line similar to deny unix addr=@**, to your policy. It is best practice to run containers with a reduced set of privileges, with a non-zero UID, and with isolated namespaces. The containerd maintainers strongly advise against sharing namespaces with the host. Reducing the set of isolation mechanisms used for a container necessarily increases that container's privilege, regardless of what container runtime is used for running that container.",

Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named process. However, remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible.
