			"text": "This update for docker fixes the following issues:\n\n- Update docker-buildx to v0.19.2. See upstream changelog online at\n  <https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.19.2>.\n\n  Some notable changelogs from the last update:\n    * <https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.19.0>\n    * <https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.18.0>\n\n- Add a new toggle file /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable which allows users to\n  disable the SUSEConnect integration with Docker (which creates special mounts\n  in /run/secrets to allow container-suseconnect to authenticate containers\n  with registries on registered hosts). bsc#1231348 bsc#1232999\n\n  In order to disable these mounts, just do\n\n    echo 0 > /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable\n\n  and restart Docker. In order to re-enable them, just do\n\n    echo 1 > /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable\n\n  and restart Docker. Docker will output information on startup to tell you\n  whether the SUSE secrets feature is enabled or not.\n\n- Disable docker-buildx builds for SLES. It turns out that build containers\n  with docker-buildx don't currently get the SUSE secrets mounts applied,\n  meaning that container-suseconnect doesn't work when building images.\n  bsc#1233819\n\n- Remove DOCKER_NETWORK_OPTS from docker.service. This was removed from\n  sysconfig a long time ago, and apparently this causes issues with systemd in\n  some cases.\n\n- Allow a parallel docker-stable RPM to exists in repositories.\n\n- Update to docker-buildx v0.17.1 to match standalone docker-buildx package we\n  are replacing. See upstream changelog online at\n  <https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.17.1>\n\n- Allow users to disable SUSE secrets support by setting\n  DOCKER_SUSE_SECRETS_ENABLE=0 in /etc/sysconfig/docker. (bsc#1231348)\n\n- Mark docker-buildx as required since classic 'docker build' has been\n  deprecated since Docker 23.0. (bsc#1230331)\n\n- Import docker-buildx v0.16.2 as a subpackage. Previously this was a separate\n  package, but with docker-stable it will be necessary to maintain the packages\n  together and it makes more sense to have them live in the same OBS package.\n  (bsc#1230333)\n\n- Update to Docker 26.1.5-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  <https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.1/#2615>\n  bsc#1230294\n\n- This update includes fixes for:\n  * CVE-2024-41110. bsc#1228324\n  * CVE-2023-47108. bsc#1217070 bsc#1229806\n  * CVE-2023-45142. bsc#1228553 bsc#1229806\n\n- Update to Docker 26.1.4-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  <https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.1/#2614>\n\n- Update to Docker 26.1.0-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  <https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.1/#2610>\n\n- Update --add-runtime to point to correct binary path.",

A handler wrapper out of the box adds labels `http.user_agent` and `http.method` that have unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent to it. HTTP header User-Agent or HTTP method for requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random and long. The library internally uses `httpconv.ServerRequest` that records every value for HTTP `method` and `User-Agent`. In order to be affected, a program has to use the `otelhttp.NewHandler` wrapper and not filter any unknown HTTP methods or User agents on the level of CDN, LB, previous middleware, etc. Version 0.44.0 fixed this issue when the values collected for attribute `http.request.method` were changed to be restricted to a set of well-known values and other high cardinality attributes were removed. As a workaround to stop being affected, `otelhttp.WithFilter()` can be used, but it requires manual careful configuration to not log certain requests entirely. For convenience and safe usage of this library, it should by default mark with the label `unknown` non-standard HTTP methods and User agents to show that such requests were made but do not increase cardinality. In case someone wants to stay with the current behavior, library API should allow to enable it.",

					"text": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.\n\nUsing a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.\n\nA security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.\n\nDocker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.\n\ndocker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches. If one is unable to upgrade immediately, avoid using AuthZ plugins and/or restrict access to the Docker API to trusted parties, following the principle of least privilege.",
