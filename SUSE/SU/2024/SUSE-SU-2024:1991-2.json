The DLV has been decommisioned since unbound\n  1.5.4 and has been advised to stop using it since. The use of\n  dlv options displays a warning.\n* Remove EDNS lame procedure, do not re-query without EDNS after\n  timeout.\n* Add DNS over HTTPS\n* libunbound has been upgraded to major version 8\n\nSecurity Fixes:\n* CVE-2023-50387: DNSSEC verification complexity can be\n  exploited to exhaust CPU resources and stall DNS resolvers.  [bsc#1219823]\n* CVE-2023-50868: NSEC3 closest encloser proof can exhaust CPU.\n  [bsc#1219826]\n* CVE-2022-30698: Novel 'ghost domain names' attack by\n  introducing subdomain delegations.  [bsc#1202033]\n* CVE-2022-30699: Novel 'ghost domain names' attack by\n  updating almost expired delegation information.  [bsc#1202031]\n* CVE-2022-3204: NRDelegation attack leads to uncontrolled\n  resource consumption (Non-Responsive Delegation Attack).  [bsc#1203643]\n\nPackaging Changes:\n\n* Use prefixes instead of sudo in unbound.service\n* Remove no longer necessary BuildRequires: libfstrm-devel and\n  libprotobuf-c-devel\n",

This action can be repeated before expiry of the delegation information by querying Unbound for a second level subdomain which the rogue nameserver provides new delegation information. Since Unbound is a child-centric resolver, the ever-updating child delegation information can keep a rogue domain name resolvable long after revocation.

				{
					"text": "A vulnerability named 'Non-Responsive Delegation Attack' (NRDelegation Attack) has been discovered in various DNS resolving software. The NRDelegation Attack works by having a malicious delegation with a considerable number of non responsive nameservers. The attack starts by querying a resolver for a record that relies on those unresponsive nameservers. The attack can cause a resolver to spend a lot of time/resources resolving records under a malicious delegation point where a considerable number of unresponsive NS records reside. It can trigger high CPU usage in some resolver implementations that continually look in the cache for resolved NS records in that delegation. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in orchestrated attacks. Unbound does not suffer from high CPU usage, but resources are still needed for resolving the malicious delegation. Unbound will keep trying to resolve the record until hard limits are reached. Based on the nature of the attack and the replies, different limits could be reached. From version 1.16.3 on, Unbound introduces fixes for better performance when under load, by cutting opportunistic queries for nameserver discovery and DNSKEY prefetching and limiting the number of times a delegation point can issue a cache lookup for missing records.",
